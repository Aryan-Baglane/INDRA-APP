## INDRA – Rainwater Harvesting Feasibility Assessment System

INDRA is a software project designed to assess the feasibility of rooftop rainwater harvesting for residential properties. The system collects property and location details from users, processes the inputs using predefined assessment logic, and generates feasibility results along with structured reports for reference.

The application enables users to authenticate securely, select or enter property location information, provide property and household details, and perform feasibility assessments. Generated reports are stored and can be accessed later through a report history feature.

The system follows a modular design consisting of a user interface layer for interaction, an application logic layer for validation and assessment processing, and a data persistence layer for managing user data and assessment reports. Location-based context and stored environmental data are used to support the assessment process.

The project includes comprehensive documentation covering software requirements, system models, user interface prototypes, testing and validation, and requirements traceability. Functional, integration, and non-functional testing were performed to ensure correctness, reliability, and usability of the system.

INDRA is intended as a decision-support tool to aid understanding of rainwater harvesting feasibility and is based on simplified assumptions. The results generated by the system are indicative and meant for informational purposes.
